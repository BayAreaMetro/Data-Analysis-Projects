=================

Typical weekday summaries of FasTrak transactions.  For transportation planning purposes, we seek to understand a 'typical' weekday behavior, which we define here to occur on non-Holiday Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays in the months of March, April, May, September, October, and November. Methods herein strive to process data provided by the FasTrak team to inform estimates of typical weekday transactions through time.  

The summaries are displayed interactively via Tableau [here](http://analytics.mtc.ca.gov/foswiki/Main/FasTrakTransactionsThroughTime); the data can be downloaded in the 'aggregate-fastrak' folder [here](https://mtcdrive.box.com/share-data).
