## Major Transit Stops 2017

### Description

This dataset contains major transit stops in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area as defined in the California Public Resources Code, [Section 21064.3](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=21064.3.&amp;lawCode=PRC):

An existing rail transit station, a ferry terminal served by either a bus or rail transit service, or the intersection of two or more major bus routes with a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods.

The data set was developed using several data sources that include Planned Transit Systems identified in the Plan Bay Area 2040 Regional Transportation Plan, Existing Transit locations extracted from the 511 Regional Transit Database, and manual editing conducted by the Spatial Modeling team at MTC.

## High-Quality Transit Corridors 2017  

### Description

This dataset contains high-quality transit corridors in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area as defined in the California Public Resources Code, [Section 21155 (b)(3)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PRC&sectionNum=21155.&highlight=true&keyword=Transit%20Priority%20Project), consistent with Senate Bill 375:

- Existing fixed-route bus corridor with headway of 15 minutes or better during both the morning and evening peak periods; or
- Fixed-route bus corridor with headway of 15 minutes or better during both the morning and evening peak periods in an adopted RTP

This data set was developed using several data sources that include Planned Transit Systems identified in the Plan Bay Area 2040 Regional Transportation Plan, Existing Transit locations extracted from the 511 Regional Transit Database, and manual editing conducted by the Spatial Modeling team at MTC. Note that the corridor alignments were developed using the best available data or, when necessary, by identifying the shortest route between two consecutive stops on that service.

### Data

Below we provide the relevant "corridors" as 1/4 mile and 1/2 mile from the route center-line.  

Some legislation (e.g. [Transit Priority Project-Eligible Areas 2017](#Transit-Priority-Project-Eligible-Areas-2017)) refers to a 'corridor' as a 1/4 mile and some as a 1/2 mile (e.g [Infill Opportunity Zone-Eligible Areas 2017](#Infill-Opportunity-Zone-Eligible-Areas-2017)).

## Infill Opportunity Zone-Eligible Areas 2017

### Description

This dataset contains locations that meet _location_ eligibility criteriaforInfill Opportunity Zones in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area as defined in the California Government Code, [Section 65088.1(e)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=65088.1&amp;lawCode=GOV):

- Within ½ mile of a **Major Transit stop** , defined as any of the following:
  - Existing rail stations
  - Planned rail stations in an adopted RTP
  - Existing ferry terminals with bus or rail service
  - Planned ferry terminals with bus or rail service in an adopted RTP
  - Intersection of at least two existing or planned bus routes with headways of 15 minutes or better during both the morning and evening peak periods; or
- Within a ½ mile of a **High-Quality transit corridor** , defined as an existing or planned fixed-route bus corridor with headway of 15 minutes or better during both the morning and evening peak periods

_Note that to become an Infill Opportunity Zone, an area must be adopted through local government resolution, consistent with_ [_Section 65088.4(c)_](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=65088.4&amp;lawCode=GOV) _of the California Government Code. For the purposes of that process, the applicable Sustainable Communities Strategy is Plan Bay Area 2040, and the relevant underlying geographic areas are those in this dataset._

The data set was developed using several data sources that include Planned Transit Systems identified in the Plan Bay Area 2040 Regional Transportation Plan, Existing Transit locations extracted from the 511 Regional Transit Database, and manual editing conducted by the Spatial Modeling team at MTC.
