# Housing Element Site Selection Pre-Screening Tool & Mapping

## Define the Problem Statement
Provide a map-based Housing Element Site Selection Tool to guide Bay Area local jurisdictions in identifying potential sites for new housing in Housing Elements that align with state requirements and support regional growth, equity, and GHG reduction priorities.Â 

Key issues to resolve include:  
- Ensuring cities have adequate information to identify if a site meetings minimum state requirements - including - -
- Affirmatively Forwarding Fair Housing - and, if not, what steps need to be taken to ensure eligibility. (primary issue)
- Integrating regional equity and GHG reduction priorities (primary issue)
- Getting official, or at least unofficial, sign off from the state (HCD) on our inputs and outputs (primary issue, but after first two bullets)
- Providing robust implementation strategies/policies for cities to consider based upon (secondary issue; can be added to minimum viable product)
