**Definitions in SB 50**

***Transit-Rich Areas***

"Transit-rich areas" are currently defined as areas within 1/2 mile of a major transit stop and areas within a 1/4-mile radius of a stop on a high-quality bus corridor.

***Major Transit Stop***

"Major transit stop" means a rail transit station or a ferry terminal that is a major transit stop pursuant to subdivision (b) of [Section 21155 of the Public Resources Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PRC&division=13.&title=&part=&chapter=4.2.&article=). 

***High-Quality Bus Corridor***

“High-Quality Bus Corridor” means a corridor with fixed route bus service that meets all of the following criteria:
1. It has average service intervals of no more than 10 minutes during the three peak hours between 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., inclusive, and the three peak hours between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m., inclusive, on Monday through Friday.
2. It has average service intervals of no more than 20 minutes during the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., p.m., inclusive, on Monday through Friday.
3. It has average intervals of no more than 30 minutes during the hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., inclusive, on Saturday and Sunday.

Our analysis has interpreted that all 3 of these conditions need to be met inclusively for a corridor to be considered a "High-Quality Bus Corridor". 

***Exclusion Area***

SB 50 Exclusion Areas are defined as follows:
1. A coastal zone, as defined in Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code, within a city with a population of less than 50,000.
2. A very high fire hazard severity zone, as determined by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pursuant to Section 51178, or within a very high fire hazard severity zone as indicated on maps adopted by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pursuant to Section 4202 of the Public Resources Code. 
A parcel is not ineligible if it is either of the following:
2.(A) A site excluded from the specified hazard zones by a local agency, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 51179.
2.(B) A site that has adopted fire hazard mitigation measures pursuant to existing building standards or state fire mitigation measures applicable to the development.
3. A parcel that is a contributing parcel within a historic district established by an ordinance of the local government that was in effect as of December 31, 2010. (NOT MAPPED)

If the residential development is located within a county that has a population equal to or less than 600,000, the residential development satisfies all of the following additional requirements:
1. The site satisfies the requirements specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 65913.4.
The site is not located within either of the following:
2. An architecturally or historically significant historic district, as defined in subdivision (h) of Section 5020.1 of the Public Resources Code. (NOT MAPPED)
3. A flood plain as determined by maps promulgated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless the development has been issued a flood plain development permit pursuant to Part 59 (commencing with Section 59.1) and Part 60 (commencing with Section 60.1) of Subchapter B of Chapter I of Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
