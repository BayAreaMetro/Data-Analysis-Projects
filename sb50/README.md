**Definition in SB 50**

d. “High-Quality Bus Corridor” means a corridor with fixed route bus service that meets all of the following criteria:
1. It has average service intervals of no more than 15 minutes during the three peak hours between 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., inclusive, and the three peak hours between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m., inclusive, on Monday through Friday.
2. It has average service intervals of no more than 20 minutes during the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., p.m., inclusive, on Monday through Friday.
3. It has average intervals of no more than 30 minutes during the hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., inclusive, on Saturday and Sunday.

Our analysis has interpreted that all 3 of these conditions need to be met inclusively for a corridor to be considered a "High-Quality Bus Corridor".
